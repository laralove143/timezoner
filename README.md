goodbye to timezone conversions! just some time in chat and everyone magically sees it in their own timezone!

![example](example.gif)

## commands
### /timezone `timezone`
yes you need this because time sucks, it's just a one-time copy-paste from [a timezone picker](https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker) though
### /time `hour` `minute` `am_pm` `day` `month` `year`
an alternative to auto-convert, also supports dates
### /enable_auto_convert
enables auto-convert feature again
