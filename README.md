goodbye to timezone conversions! just type some time in chat and everyone magically sees it in their own timezone!

![example](example.gif)

## usage
to send times, the bot needs to know your timezone first, just type `/timezone` and it’ll suggest timezones for you
- you only do this once of course
- only the people that type times need to do this, the rest reading the time don't need to do anything!

there’s also a `/copy` command that you can use to share times in dms etc.
