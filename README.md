goodbye to timezone conversions! this bot tries to make sharing times/dates with your friends all over the world easier

## commands
### /set_timezone
yes you need this because time sucks, it's just a one-time copy-paste from [a timezone picker](https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker) though
### /time
give it an hour and give it a minute, and it will send a magical little message that shows that time in everyone's own timezone!
### /date
useful for like sharing your wedding date since you don't want your friends to be late.. it's still useful even if you don't have a wedding date tho! (i wouldn't make a command that's useful for nobody)

## nerdy stuff
made with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Twilight](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight) and SQLite.. basically meaning it's good™️
