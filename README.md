goodbye to timezone conversions! this bot makes sharing times/dates with your friends all over the world easier! now you just type the time and everyone magically sees it in their own timezone!

now instead of *"i'll be home in 1, 2, 3, 4.. 6 hours? i think?"* and have people count you can just do *"i'll be home at 4pm"* and people will see 5am and realize they'd be asleep by then..

## commands
### /timezone [timezone]
yes you need this because time sucks, it's just a one-time copy-paste from [a timezone picker](https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker) though
### /time [hour] [minute] (am_pm) (day) (month) (year)
give it an hour and give it a minute, in am-pm or in 24-hour, maybe it a day, maybe a month, maybe a year, and it will send a magical little message that shows that time or date in everyone's own timezone!
